# Printing-Shapes
This code is used to manipulate the algorithms to print some shapes with the given length.
The code also includes an infinite loop that continuously displays a menu of options for the user to choose from. The user can select a shape to print (pyramid, square, reverse pyramid, right-angle pyramid, or circle) by entering the corresponding number. Entering 6 allows the user to exit the program, and entering any other number displays "invalid input."
